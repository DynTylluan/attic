# Freedoom Attic

Since starting in 2003, Freedoom has changed a lot since its inception and the Attic is proof of this, as it contains resources previously submitted to Freedoom, but have since been replaced or were _never_ used in the first place due to a number of wild reasons, such as being outdated - despite this, the many people behind Freedoom are grateful for the work of people who have made content for the game, even if it is no longer used.

Be aware that, unlike now, Freedoom was not always meant to be a vanilla-only set of IWADs, meaning that to play some of the WADs here, an advanced Doom source port, such as [QZDoom](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/QZDoom), [PrBoom](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/PrBoom), [Pooch](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Pooch) or any other port that is [Boom-compatible](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Category:Boom_compatible).

As with most things relating to Freedoom, all of the contents in this git [use the same license](COPYING.adoc) as the main Freedoom project.
